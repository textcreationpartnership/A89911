            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:165703:3"/>Souldiers; for if they were allowed 60 in a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, they would not keep above 30. and the reaÅ¿on was (the Capt. Å¿ay) for want of current payment, being forct to make uÅ¿e of men called Soliciteurs to furniÅ¿h them with Money, who deduct above 20 or 25 <hi>Per. cent.</hi> for their disburÅ¿ment. Now the EÅ¿tates of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> indeed, did not Å¿o much deÅ¿ire to disband any Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; but that the Companies being Å¿o Å¿mall, they might disband Å¿ome Officers, and keep up all the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and by caÅ¿hiering of thoÅ¿e Soliciteurs, and by managing the buÅ¿ineÅ¿s well in paying the Souldiers currently themÅ¿elves, they would Å¿ave 100000 pound <hi>Per Annum.</hi> The <hi>major</hi> Vote in the States General was, to Å¿ide with the Prince, the one having a Brother a Soliciteur, a CouÅ¿en perhaps a Col. another friend a Capt. &amp;c. and they petitioning them and the P. of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi> continually to be kept up, and not disbanded: reÅ¿olved they would live and dy with each other, (now you muÅ¿t take notice that all the States General did not give their Votes to this, but the Major part; for 2 or 3 Provinces have Å¿ince proteÅ¿ted againÅ¿t their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings) and then the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> CavelieriÅ¿h Col. and Capt. under his Command, with thoÅ¿e of the States General, (that had voted they Å¿hould not be disbanded) tickled him in the ear with many Å¿trang things that they would do for him, and to curb <hi>Holland</hi> by the Å¿word, and to make him a Soveraign of theÅ¿e Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and certainly to effect this, he wanted none of <hi>Charles Stuarts</hi> Councel, nor of his mother <hi>Mall</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> Malignants here did report tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

That Å¿ame day <hi>viz.</hi> the 30. <hi>alias</hi> 20. <hi>July,</hi> the Prince gave CommiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion for his Army to march out of GariÅ¿on to <hi>AmÅ¿ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam;</hi> where on <hi>Saturday</hi> laÅ¿t in the morning, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 2000 horÅ¿e and 1000 foot; but being diÅ¿covered by the <hi>Hamborough PoÅ¿t,</hi> the Lords of the Town were acquainted therewith, and command was given, the Gates Å¿hould be Å¿hut, and the Magazine being opened, about 300 pieces of Ordnance, was by the boys and labourers in the Å¿treets drag'd up to the wals and Scon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Drums beat for the trained bands to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ently in Arms, which was effected: as alÅ¿o the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery that belongs to the Town, being about 5 or 600 were alÅ¿o in Arms, &amp; kept Å¿trict watch both at gates &amp;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:165703:4"/>walls, the Å¿ame day a Company of their Soldiers with Carpenters went out, and cut down all draw Bridges, and got men of war in great number, to lye from <hi>Texel</hi> to the River <hi>Tye,</hi> for fear of forces to come in by Sea (as was reported) from <hi>Zealand,</hi> the mean time drums beat for to liÅ¿t Soldiers in the Town, and gave 15 <hi>Å¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> a day, and in 2 days time had above 12000 Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in pay, on the Lords day they in the Town Å¿et o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their Å¿luces, and drowned all the land round about, Å¿o that the <hi>Princes</hi> Å¿ouldiery was forc't to keep on the bank-Å¿ides, which were high; the mean time moÅ¿t part of all his Army came down thither both horÅ¿e &amp; Foot, and laid Å¿iege to it; and in 2 or 3 places began to make works againÅ¿t it. Take notice that till the Lords day noone he himÅ¿elf remained in the <hi>Hague,</hi> and knew no otherwiÅ¿e but his men were got into <hi>AmÅ¿terdam:</hi> but when he heard the contrary, he was mad and ready to tare his hair off his head, and Å¿eeing himÅ¿elf thus deprived of his hopes in the deÅ¿ign, he (like a Lyon robbed of her whelps) did Å¿o take on, and immediatly in perÅ¿on went to the leaguer; where in a rage, as before mentioned, he began to raiÅ¿e works, but to no purpoÅ¿e. The mean time, this town of <hi>Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdam</hi> Å¿tood nutral, and we expected every hour that Å¿ome of his Souldiers would come and quarter upon us, but did not, and <hi>Dort, Delph, Leyden, Harlen</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Townes Å¿hut their Gates, and were in Arms. On <hi>Munday</hi> and <hi>TueÅ¿day</hi> the EÅ¿tates of <hi>Holland</hi> (conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of one or two men out of each Town) met, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿olved to Å¿end for him home, and the States Gen. Å¿ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his deÅ¿ign broke, they moÅ¿t of them fell off from him, and both Å¿ent a Committee to him to Treat, and thoÅ¿e alÅ¿o of <hi>AmÅ¿terdam</hi> Å¿ent to him, and on <hi>WedneÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> laÅ¿t they were agreed as followeth.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:165703:4"/>
            <p>That the Army Å¿hall again march to their quarters, and the town Å¿hall not be moleÅ¿ted; but that trading may be free, and thoÅ¿e that were the cauÅ¿ers of this trouble, Å¿hall give an account for it afterward; which Å¿hall be diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted at the next meeting at the HAGUE.</p>
            <p>It is my opinion, that though the buÅ¿ineÅ¿s is appeaÅ¿ed for the preÅ¿ent; yet Å¿ome heads will fly for it, and the P. himÅ¿elf, if his head remains on his Å¿houlders, it will be well: however they all Å¿ay, they will take a great part of his power from him. Certainly if he had taken AMSTERDAM, he would have made himÅ¿elf Soveraign of theÅ¿e Countries, to have made Å¿laves of theÅ¿e people of Holland; His intentions were to have Å¿eized upon the Banck there, and the Å¿tock of the town, which is many millions. The people in general hate this odious deÅ¿ign of his, and as well Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trates as people Å¿ay plainly, they may thank his brother Charls for this, and had he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his deÅ¿i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e, he had moÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿uredly curb'd the EÅ¿tates of Holland for their friendly aÅ¿siÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or correÅ¿pondency, and would have bin very able to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t his Brother; but we may Å¿ee much of God in this buÅ¿ineÅ¿s, and I hope
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:165703:5"/>theÅ¿e Countries will make a faÅ¿ter union with <hi>England</hi> then ever yet they have done. The <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> Malignants here, are Å¿ad at this buÅ¿ineÅ¿s, for they were in hopes, and were confidently aÅ¿Å¿ured had this deÅ¿ign gone on, that their deÅ¿ign alÅ¿o would be promoted by it. I have thus as near as I can, given you the relation of this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ineÅ¿s; for any other particulars, I refer you to <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿terdam</hi> Letters, <hi>Vale.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the troubles had continued, I had Å¿ent my wife &amp; child to <hi>London per</hi> this paÅ¿Å¿age now a going, <hi>per</hi> whom alÅ¿o many families of our <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> would have gone, all things being packed up in a readineÅ¿s; but now we Å¿hall wait to Å¿ee what God Å¿hall farther do with us. Some of your Company removed their cloth to <hi>Zealand,</hi> for it was not here without danger; For a great many Companies of <hi>Souldiers</hi> were quartered at the <hi>Hague</hi> and we did expect them or others here, and the Malignants would have been favoured, but the better party burthened.</p>
            <p>The Lord of <hi>Dort</hi> that was taken priÅ¿oner (by name <hi>De Witt</hi>) is dead, its thought poyÅ¿oned.</p>
